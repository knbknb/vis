## vis.js

Vis.js is a dynamic, browser based visualization library.
The library is designed to be easy to use, handle large amounts
of dynamic data, and enable manipulation of the data.
The library consists of the following components:

- DataSet and DataView. A flexible key/value based data set. Add, update, and
  remove items. Subscribe on changes in the data set. A DataSet can filter and
  order items, and convert fields of items.
- DataView. A filtered and/or formatted view on a DataSet.
- Graph2d. Plot data on a timeline with lines or barcharts.
- Graph3d. Display data in a three dimensional graph.
- Network. Display a network (force directed graph) with nodes and edges.
- Timeline. Display different types of data on a timeline.

The vis.js library was initially developed by [Almende B.V](http://almende.com).
